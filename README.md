I enjoyed making this game. It was a blast learning how to use Unity but it was also very difficult since I had to learn it in such a short time. I had some difficulties with making the game such as making the jump buttons and animations as my animations and characters were different from the video so I had to scale them to their size and use different animations. I had a ton of fun making the level. I had planned to make a shoot button but I noticed that if I shot one of the ninjas they would disappear and that would make the game a whole lot easier. It dawned on me that I had to make health bars for the ninjas and block buttons and such which I ended up not having enough time for so I decided to get rid of the shooting button in general and just stick with a regular 2D platformer. One of the problems I encountered were that I did not use all the videos in the playlist because some of the things I did not need, but on the videos that I did watch, he had placed code or used code that I did not have from previous videos, so I had to improvise and find out that best place to put the code. I learned how to use Unity and a very little bit of C# but not a bunch. I also learned a little bit of implementing animations and I learned that making a game is not easy. Also I am unsure if I submitted my project to GitHub correctly, as submitting for Unity is very different. I submmited my script folder which has all the code for my sprites etc and my animation folder. I believe these folders were the most important so I submmited them. Thank you Professor Rosen.
